# HW7 - BLE-Based Distance Estimation Experiment

## Objective
The goal of this experiment is to collect RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values from BLE advertisements and observe how they vary with distance.  
Rather than calculating distance using a formula, we focus on analyzing the correlation between actual distance and average RSSI values.

## System Configuration
- **BLE Server**: Sends BLE advertisements using the device name `"HW7_SERVER"`
- **BLE Client**: Scans for nearby BLE devices, filters by name, and collects RSSI values
- **Hardware**: 2 Ã— ESP32 boards
- **Output**: RSSI values printed to the serial monitor

## Experiment Method
1. Place the BLE server and client at fixed distances (0.5m to 3.0m)
2. Run a BLE scan for 5 seconds at each position
3. Collect and average multiple RSSI readings per distance
4. Record the results in a table for analysis

## RSSI vs. Estimated Distance Table

| Measurement No. | RSSI (dBm) | Estimated Distance (m) |
|------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| 1                | -72        | 1.18                     |
| 2                | -72        | 1.18                     |
| 3                | -80        | 2.28                     |
| 4                | -80        | 2.28                     |
| 5                | -84        | 3.16                     |
| 6                | -83        | 2.91                     |

## Analysis
- RSSI values decreased consistently as distance increased.
- Signal fluctuations occurred due to indoor obstacles and interference.
- The results show that BLE RSSI can provide a rough distance estimate,  
  but it requires averaging, filtering, or further calibration for practical use.
